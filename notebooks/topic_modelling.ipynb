    "Game reviews are a great source of information for players. From the company's point of view, online reviews can be used to gauge feedback on the game. However, since these reviews can be overwhelming in terms of numbers and information, we can use topic modeling to find key insights. This enables people wanting to play the game to quickly extract key information without having the tedious task of going through every review. As well, this serves as another avenue of information that the company can use to inform product decisions."

Haven't played in any tournaments yet but I'm still practicing. The game lay out is nice very smooth playing. I'd give it 5 stars if there would be some more options to play like omha or black jack. But then again the game is called zynga poker not casino. Love it.</td>\n",

And a little bigger bonuses for some players that have been playing for the 7-10 year Fram that you've been on here...I love playing Zynga because you have to think about what you're doing... It's not like other poker sites where they give you millions of chips everyday... It's strategic playing that gets you where you want to be...a few weeks back I was number one on the league board... Then I didn't win a tourney for like a week...I think getting to that high of money count... Would have been a Chip bonus and the coupons... Just a thought...I think if you make in the top 10 or something it should be done consolation of chips as well as the coupons to move up in the ranking... Those are my thoughts...

Ive lost 6 times tonight because someone has had a higher fullhouse or they have had a better 3 of a kind. I can be a good sport for a couple. But 6 times in a half hour is a bit extreme.   \n",

I also bought a lot of permanent items with gold on the Pc \\nFacebook version which I have no access too, since the latest update (which \\nI like, just miss my items lol) These items were really cool. (Pigzy and a \\nMonkey character) I liked the fact that you could also do a lot more with \\ngold in the online shop to buy items. Other than that I really recommend \\nZynga poker!   \n",

Shame everyone goes all in on first round of tournaments, but this is not Zyngas fault.   On the down side, chips have little value because of how easy they are to obtain without even playing. For a more realistic simulation; dont accept gifts, watch adds, purchase chips or use free spins on the fruity.  5 star app all the way!   \n",

Always time super hit game is zynaga poker. Really loving much... I said tht before I really loved the game. But one think I didn't get it when I playing on big table I losses all my chips but why.....? No problem I consider only for I loved tht game. I don't understand why the dealer didn't show the right card, I take the risk and lost my all chips but why? It's great game I ever play.

       "172665  I wish there were more level's.. And a little bigger bonuses for some players that have been playing for the 7-10 year Fram that you've been on here...I love playing Zynga because you have to think about what you're doing... It's not like other poker sites where they give you millions of chips everyday... It's strategic playing that gets you where you want to be...a few weeks back I was number one on the league board... Then I didn't win a tourney for like a week...I think getting to that high of money count... Would have been a Chip bonus and the coupons... Just a thought...I think if you make in the top 10 or something it should be done consolation of chips as well as the coupons to move up in the ranking... Those are my thoughts... Thank you for having Zynga poker it's an awesome game!!   \n",

It's not like other poker sites where they give you millions of chips everyday... It's strategic playing that gets you where you want to be...a few weeks back I was number one on the league board... Then I didn't win a tourney for like a week...I think getting to that high of money count... Would have been a Chip bonus and the coupons... Just a thought...I think if you make in the top 10 or something it should be done consolation of chips as well as the coupons to move up in the ranking... Those are my thoughts...

The main issue is the fact that the cards given are too random and 9 times out of 10 it's so random that even if you do bluff, you lose to the callers. At the same time, if you do have a hand, the community cards work against you. The hands/community cards are so unrealistic and punishing that you are forced to buy chips or watch ads. Now Zynga is forcing ads on you regardless. Unfortunate that you can't enjoy more sensible hands.</td>\n",

I don't think you can improve this game, because you can't get past gouging for money, it is udicrous having a free game but costs a small fortune to play it and if course if you give a bad review....you lose every hand , paid chips or free chips, no matter.

These pop-ups happen when you leave a table to go to the lobby, they happened when you enter Zynga game itself, every time you change a screen you get a pop up. And it's very big brotherish. They know every website I've been to because the pop-ups are things I've ordered online or I've looked at. There are better games out there now that these pop-ups have appeared   \n",

Every few days I am ask if I would like to leave a review getting 1st review Five stars is a rating, it could have been 4 stars but I chose the 5. sometimes I really dislike rating games and apps but what the hell. So here I am rating this one so hopefully it will quit asking me to rate. The Zynga App is decent, really decent. I've never been to Florida but if I ever go I will definitely bring my personal cell phone with this app still installed. Not if I drive but like if I fly, yes   \n",

I get a really good hand like a full house and someone always has a higher one. My mother in law plays and wins nearly every hand. But it seems that every hand i get i cant win because someone always has better. It seems like the game is rigged. Ive lost 6 times tonight because someone has had a higher fullhouse or they have had a better 3 of a kind. I can be a good sport for a couple. But 6 times in a half hour is a bit extreme.   \n",

On another occasion in consecutive hands I had a straight followed by King high flush followed by ace high flush followed by full house. All lost! All to the same player! All on the river.

Horrible customer service, no resolution to in game cheaters and hackers, and obvious collusion with other player cheat groups. Do not waste your time or money on this game. I will not change my rating till the issues are fixed. Zynga doesn't care about people getting screwed out of their money. It is built into their algorithms to get you to spend. They allow these scammers to thrive. F U ZYNGA.   \n",

Shame everyone goes all in on first round of tournaments, but this is not Zyngas fault.   On the down side, chips have little value because of how easy they are to obtain without even playing. For a more realistic simulation; dont accept gifts, watch adds, purchase chips or use free spins on the fruity.  5 star app all the way!   \n",

And a little bigger bonuses for some players that have been playing for the 7-10 year Fram that you've been on here...I love playing Zynga because you have to think about what you're doing... It's not like other poker sites where they give you millions of chips everyday... It's strategic playing that gets you where you want to be...a few weeks back I was number one on the league board... Then I didn't win a tourney for like a week...I think getting to that high of money count... Would have been a Chip bonus and the coupons... Just a thought...I think if you make in the top 10 or something it should be done consolation of chips as well as the coupons to move up in the ranking... Those are my thoughts... Thank you for having Zynga poker it's an awesome game!!   \n",

One can't use their social media pic but the game play is really good, it's no frills, no bells, whistles & trumpets but is clear & concise. Being petty I do have 2 gripes which are that table chat is very time limited so this isn't really a social hand of cards AND WITH EITHER SOUND OR VIBRATION IS ALWAYS DINGING OR BUZZING EXCESSIVELY as it happens at the start of one's turn and at the end of one's turn. It should do so when doing something is required only. I play in bed before sleep finds me and even on vibration it makes sound, annoying wife who's trying to settle for sleep. Sounds & vibration off is best option.   \n",

Though I loved the previous web version the UI is no doubt the best. I would prefer the web version than this phone app. There was so many different ways to interact with the game in that setup. Rigged or not, this game sure does test your patience. And it will pay off in the end. The Trillion dollar table is way exaggerated imo.

In the last couple years it has became so obvious that the game is rigged & trust me when l tell you. The deck is definitely stacked against you. It's a shame to see what once was a great game to just fall off the way Zynga Poker has.   \n",

But its really doesnt seem fair at all. Why is my win rate 20% and others 30%. Theres not much skill. Its the algorithm that determines it. Either im extremely unlucky and keep losing or the algorithm needs some tweaking. But the fairness doesn't seem fair. Just the amount of losses puts me off playing. Also it's extremely annoying ti have all these 'send chips' and 'watch video' boxes appear every time you load up the app. Please just give an option to disable it. I just saw a guy with 39% win rate. Now that's totally bs   \n",

Some players more than other but I still enjoy playing. All players must be made to play at least 5 to 10 games on the tables they sit at, this hopefully would cut down on so called \" bingo\" players and give other players chance to win back some chips they have lost to these hit and run players   \n",

It is a lot of fun. The reason i gave it 4 stars instead of five is because I wish there was some sort of \"stealth\" mode. Sometimes I just want to be left alone to play and not have my friends follow me to tables. Also, the fold, call and raise buttons are kind of close together. I've hit call on accident when I meant to fold a couple of times. Also, to all those people saying the game is rigged... Maybe you just can't play poker very well???   \n",

Not to mention that hold em tables are ridiculously popular now, to the point where my game won't let me join tables under the notice that \"there are no free tables\". No that could be me, but I feel that it's something wrong with the game itself.   \n",

Lots of new players with a lot of chips they bought in the store bet up the hands disproportionately - you can win a lot of chips from them, but you fold a lot of hands that might have been interesting to play.   \n",

One thing I've noticed is it's not wise to buy any chips. Just play with whatever free chips you are given starting out, take advantage of challenges and build your chips from there. Soon as you buy chips you will hit a wave of absolutely frozen cards because it seems their algorithm figures you will just buy more when you lose.   \n",

A big problem I have spotted is that: Low value tournaments have many players who shove pre-flop, so it doesn't actually feel like poker, there is no point of it if every tournament has a player who shoves pre-flop!   \n",

Good game. Could be a little lighter on memory while it's running. I have a $2 phone and it freezes occasionally. All in all it's fun and it passes the time. If you are any good at poker then the free chips you get are enough. In this regard this game is different than others, you don't have to spend money to play.   \n",

Good or bad, its very addictive...& as to giving it a 4 🌟🌟🌟🌟star?..BUT WOULD have given it a five star IF ONLY the app would allow the \"Non FaceBook users\" to somehow use their own \"profile pics\", as opposed to the caricature pics they offer & have no other choice but to use (because of not using facebook). In my opinion? It should be an \"option\". Optional, in that regardless of facebooking or not? Everyone should have that choice.(Why you ask? Well,) ...in the end, I feel that using your actual profile pic makes \"sitting at the table\" \"more personal\" & gives it a bit more of a \"realistic feel\". All in all? I give this app a respectable four 🌟🌟🌟🌟 star pat on the back. But would give it (as I know many others's would as well) a five 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 star applaud IF ONLY the \"Non Face Book'rs\" were taken a bit more seriously & given the option to be taken more seriously than a caricature.   \n",

I'm fairly new to this poker game, and must say its better than any out there. POKER players this game is better WSOP! Your spin &win truly suck! It's not random spins, it's obvious it's controlled spin. Also, fast tables SHOULD be fast tables! Very, very rarely are they fast. So many sit and run down the clock it's frustrating, so much so, I don't even want to play. How about tables for serious skilled players?   \n",

Sometimes, \"connection error and try again\" when i try to join all of the type game. Thanks   \n",

You get beat by impossible hands more often than not. Im beginning to wonder if im actually playing with people or against bots. You'll have 3 Aces, and get beat by a 4 of a kind..... EVERY TIME. it's always after you buy chips too. Im going to try and not put any more money into this app. It's laughable, just be aware is all im saying. I still like the app tho.

Bank doesn't add up and messages sometimes cover the board cards. I watched closely this time before entering a tournament, I started with 48 mil before a 5 mil buy in, won 10 mil and checked my bank again... 49 mil. Who taught you math? This is after the \"house\" already takes a huge 17 percent rake on buy ins. Also, the \"bet or fold\" banner message often covers the suits on the cards in the flop, turn and river. There is also never any explanation on how to win the \"bonus jackpots\". Otherwise, it's poker.   \n",

Several times myself or other players have had winning hands and it will give the win to someone with no hand or lesser hand. I had given this game a 5 star rating before but I have since edited my rating. The game itself plays ok but seems like whoever programmed it didn't know what the hell they were doing.   \n",

I like how you can earn pokercips by multiple ways and more often than 4 hours would be even better. I like all the different levels you can get to show the beginners froms the pros. This is by far the best poker app forvtexas hold em.   \n",

Found it funny to see that Zynga only response to people who rate the game 5 stars and say it's great. Other people who are talking about the game crashing, number of ads, etc get no response.   \n",

Even got me playing live poker at the casino's here in lake Charles. Haven't played in any tournaments yet but I'm still practicing. The game lay out is nice very smooth playing. I'd give it 5 stars if there would be some more options to play like omha or black jack. But then again the game is called zynga poker not casino. Love it.   \n",

Not only do they limit how many times someone can gift you, they limit the number of gifts you can get, which isn't very inviting if you're trying to have more friends play.   \n",

Sometimes you win a hand and the screen goes purple without an option to close it, the only option is to leave the table or close the app. If you want to play a most realistic poker, you should go to WSOP, they don't fool you like this app.   \n",

Had been playing this game on Facebook for more than 5 years and was happy to see on Android. There are several issues #1. I can only see 2 tables with stakes 100/200K & 100/200M... (earlier there were several stake tables to join) #2. Sometimes in between games the screen goes black. #3. Another thing is noticed is that this game is too Biased or the Algorithm is too shady. Not Happy at all... Currently have close to 2T chips & don't want to play this game anymore   \n",

A portion of my winnings from live play is being stolen from my account. i will sit down at a table and win 250 million but only 225 million actually gets added to my account. A rake from every pot is standard, but if i leave table up 250, i expect to receive all 250. I've suspected this for a while but now have clearly identified 30 million chips missing from my account between 2 separate sessions. Do not buy coins on this app, they'll just steal them away in the end.   \n",

However, you should be able to buy things like ticket boosts etc. With your winnings. What's the point of winning all this money just to buy drinks. It's becoming redundant. And I'm tired of losing my spin streak. I've been playing for like 8 years and if I miss one day I have to start all over for a whole week of spinning the wheel. Which is rigged anyway. The higher percentage you have, the lower your spin winnings turn out to be.   \n",

It's because you can't poker and not because there's something wrong with this app. Just because someone knows when to raise and when to wait for a better hand doesn't mean he is CHEATING. I've been using this app for a few years now and I never had to buy chips to be able to keep playing.  So this app is great!   \n",

It's fun.  The downside. I'm not sure what the chip system is but when I ever I leave a game I'm always millions out of pocket. I've never paid for a chip but considering you charge quite a pricey some for them. It's pretty much stealing from those who do. You win a hand. It takes a percentage, granted. But then when you leave play it takes more? Robbery.   \n",

The card system was buggered. And surprisingly it still is.   Here are 2 of many examples.   If I have 3 of a kind. (queen in hand 2 on table)  And so does someone else on the table, they instantly win all the chips.  But when I have a 3of a kind and someone else does and if I win the side pot. The main winnings go split between me and the other person with 3 of a kind. Why is that?  Also. Since when does a pair of 8s beat a pair of aces? I lost 138million chips on a hand I should of won. How does that work out?   \n",

The main issue is the fact that the cards given are too random and 9 times out of 10 it's so random that even if you do bluff, you lose to the callers. At the same time, if you do have a hand, the community cards work against you. The hands/community cards are so unrealistic and punishing that you are forced to buy chips or watch ads. Now Zynga is forcing ads on you regardless. Unfortunate that you can't enjoy more sensible hands.   \n",

I played for 4 hours straight just to count how many hands (win or lose) were at least decent. 2 hands out of 4 hours. This why most won't start purchasing from apps right away.   \n",

It used to be excellent, but no more. Once upon a time, new players could learn to play with blinds of $1/$2, now the minimum stakes are far too high. Even with my chips in the billions, whenever I login the app reverts to trying to play with stakes I am uncomfortable playing at. It used to be the same as I had played at the last time. The preponderance of bots now ruins the game for me. The game is now rigged in their favour. Time to uninstall.   \n",

No useless clutter and confusions. Tables are very well managed and organised.

Been playing for 2yrs and it's only crashed on me once. I haven't had to buy any chips or spend $ yet, but I've noticed it's quite reasonable to do so compared to other sites. The only issue is the bullies with 10trillion in chips sitting at the 1mil buy in tables and putting the begginers all in every single hand until they're knocked out. That's lame. More Special Tournaments (like Brad Garrett's Home Game) would warrant 5 stars.   \n",

The app's A.I. saw I increased my $$ and buy in levels, and within a couple of weeks set all new unrealistic daily challenges for me, which encourages playing at even HIGHER levels. Not cool. If I were truly addicted, I could see spending way more than my means. That could pose real harm to people with no self control. From 5 stars to 3 for ethical reasons.   \n",

Now every single time I try to play, it glitches out and kicks me completely out of the game. Last night I lost a big buy in for a tournament because it glitched during the tourney... not very ideal... hopefully that gets fixed, but besides that, its usually a great free game to play.   \n",

This makes it impossible! I now play poker part time and I have to say I'm dissappointed to see that this has turned from a 10/10free-chip poker app to a money grabbing scheme. The major poker sites have play chip versions (even for USA players) you might have to sign up, but at least you can use free chips to learn the game and actually try to win!   \n",

I do have a suggestion I think you should add a i bluffed button in the table chat it already gives the option for other poker to be mean with the tissue. I think adding that the person Bluff that hand will make the game a little interesting next time they would play somebody. this is a game where either you have it or you don't I know some other games have where you can show your cards you don't have to do that but adding adding you bluffed in the table would be cool   \n",

How on earth can two kings and two sixes beat two kings and two sevens when the fifth card is same? This is one instance but I've come across many in the course of the game. Also it seems as if you're bound to lose every time once you reach a certain level irrespective of how good your cards are. So the game becomes very boring later on. And that is why I'd not recommend spending any money on this game.   \n",

Your fair game play paid a side pot with one pair 31,000,000 then paid my main  pot winner 1,200,000 with 2 pair. Fair game play? I rather think not. That was NOT my imagination. The same thing has happened to me 3 times. I've seen it happen to others several times. Thanks Zynga Choker! So they replied for me to contact support. I've tried, several times. Most of the time it just wouldn't let me send the inquiry.   \n",

However, every time they try to put on an event, Valentine's day or now St Patrick's day, the game freezes or the game is simply unplayable. Do everyone a favor Zynga developers either debug your updates or just leave the game alone when it is working. Jun 2020. Game has become unplayable since screen blanks out either white or black while playing. Everytime they try to make an improvement the game gets messed up. When are they going to fix this?   \n",

At one time it was one bad beat after another. Now the cards being dealt are equivalent to a cash poker game. I left for a couple of years and decided to give them another try. They deserve six stars out of five. There is no constant nagging to buy chips like another poker game who barrages you time after time to take your money. I'm happy I came back, Zynga poker is a treasure to play.   \n",

Of course I thought it was great. So I played on like DANG boy got chips, thta's where I started to see the game change. Do I understand this is just a game, sure. But you need to know, the second you buy chips, the fun leaves the game, you loose,  so cudo's to whomever wrote the program for this game. The game will give you the kind of cards that you really cant fold on (full house - flush - 4 of a kind), but their will be someone there who gets the better hand, EVERYTIME. So beware people.   \n",

They have actually taken me out of gameplay forcing a fold! I've had a few issues with program locking up lately as well. Trying to contact their support is a waste of time. Even when the data they retrieved and the game images they saved supported my complaint, their reply was that I didn't understand the rules. I have 1.5B in chips or i would stop playing on their site. Every new release comes with new ways to reduce the user experience.   \n",

No idea why I can't always accept chips (Why notify if useless gifts prior to arbitrary 24 hour limit. )???? Why not accept gifts any time?  The competition is excellent, everyone is friendly. A.I. seems like fair poker. Zynga more engaging and addictive  than clunky #WSOP World series of poker competition.  I love the tournaments. Great way to kill time with a challenge.  Devs constantly updating and improving. Excellent community of mostly fantastic players and well designed interface. The best game I have played in a long time. Bravo Zynga. Soooo easy to turn off notifications can not understand why people don't change settings. So easy. So good.   \n",

The platform is professional. The recent problem is players with chips 10X the maximum. If they are winning at that rate something is wrong. I was dealt the exact same hand 4 times , an algorithm problem. All of these online games are having similar problems but the bottom line is they are free except that eventually you will lose and want to buy more chips. This app is better than most. Make your own assessment after you play. Even live games are no bargain.   \n",

Zynga's prices for chips are reasonable, or you can use your skill and win chips. You can play regular poker, or Sit-N-Go. And, you can play at your level, you're not forced into higher table limits. And, it's an easy app to learn. But, with about 10 seconds to decide there's little room for strategy. Good luck!!!   \n",

Easy controls, easy betting. The only problem is there is no double security feature on entering a tournament especially a shootout. If I accidentally hit it I'm committed to play and the chips are gone. Other then that I think it's a great poker site. I really enjoy the RPG style of obtaining levels through gaining experience. Even allowing you to show off trophies won.   \n",

Certain times of the day when playing I notice a change of cards I get dealt usually the after noon I start losing every hand forcing me to get off. I have a straight the next person always has a higher hand. Seems suspicious. I know u can't win all the time but still. Also private tables where only friends/poker buddy's can join would be a definite plus to add to the game. As some of the randoms just f around and bet all in from the start.   \n",

It's very difficult to use this app on a phone because of the bet slide button. A bigger slide button running horizontally would be a good way. It's absolutely rigged though, the minute you fold, your cards will come up and you would have been the winner, stay in the hand and you will lose. I can now predict the turn and river cards accurately because of this.   \n",

Been playing on Zynga for a lot of years, and I think the algorithms and the overall features have gotten better. Of course you might change your mind if you're on a losing streak...lol it's more funner and more better than other apps I have played on over the years. Once I had an issue where I had lost all my trophies and all my experience points, and I was impressed after contacting customer service that my features and were fully restored.

My only issue is that I have too many gifts and am unable to accept them all!  Nothing more to say except if you love Poker then you'll love this game.   \n",

But now it's become very hard to play it. as every time I'm trying to it's taking very long to open the app as it takes more than 2min to do so and after its just more longer to put you at in table that you wish to play at . And I more thing the app its self it's become very big in the data size. As it's almost 2GB of storage. I hope that you guys try to fix it ASAP . THANKS.   \n",

Any winnings or earnings from ads seem to disappear. This is very frustrating to me! I want what I earned and what I won! When I exit out and go back in, the app still gives me the same $ 990,000 amount ...no matter what.   \n",

But when you have day's that are just, fornicated... it is a really, excrement kind of experience. There is definitely something going on, because every hand is a loosing hand, I have a pair someon else has two pairs, I have two pairs someone else hase trips, I have trips someone else has a flush or a straight I have a flush someone else is in a boat... a couple of hands I get, but every hand? That's not chance, that's rigged. Funnily enough, it seems to correct itself when I purchase chips... \"cough\" scam! \"cough\"   \n",

I pity yet I ask all those who loves to play poker who wants to have fun and a nice time to download  this app and try it. Don't believe those stupid pawns who says that WSOP or other poker apps are great or amazing or whatever good things they say. I say it's BS!!! No matter how much chips you have accumulated or bought, you always end up broke and buying fake money with real ones so how can you win or have fun if the games are rigged or fix to their advantage or gain? So, try Zynga poker app and experience for yourself. Thanks. There's a question whether this is a casino game and I answered NOT SURE, that' bcoz I never, I mean NEVER played poker in casinos or any other establisnments. I' ve only seen it being played from a distance in Las Vegas and Reno, Nevada, also the French Riviera and in the movies or social gatherings.   \n",

Not been able load the game thought since latest version update. Been nearly 2 weeks now. Hope I ain't lost everything. Don't want to delete game just incase I do.  Hope a new update is done soon so I can play again. Unless it won't load because latest version is not working as a result of memory to big to load which would mean needs to go back a version to make the game playable again.  Hope you sort this issue soon   \n",

Its not FAIR at all that you have it RIGGED to give them the winning hand! I bought so many coins. I dont think I will be buying anymore. Your game does not play fair. The cards should be delt out like we play in real life with NO GLITCHES OR CHEATS!!! I SAY YOU OWE ME SOME COINS ZYNGA!   \n",

I can confidently say that their main objective above all else is to get you buy their chips using real money. So if you want to get serious, there is no way you dont spend money to get more chips. But in terms of interface, layout etc, this app is a pioneer and good at it. Just play the game for fun, and you'll be satisfied. Get serious, and you'll fall to their rigged ways of getting your real money   \n",

Horrible customer service, no resolution to in game cheaters and hackers, and obvious collusion with other player cheat groups. Do not waste your time or money on this game.

When the system not picking you whatever hands you got even you have strong hands, system will make you lose no matter what you card is.

All players are of different skill levels & by you cheating to let inferior players with inferior hands get just the cards they need to win doesn't bode them well if they decide to play live games. You are guilty of cheating here & quite possibly will cause some to lose real money in real games. You should be ashamed of not running a straight game!   \n",

Once upon a time, new players could learn to play with blinds of $1/$2, now the minimum stakes are far too high. Even with my chips in the billions, whenever I login the app reverts to trying to play with stakes I am uncomfortable playing at. It used to be the same as I had played at the last time.
